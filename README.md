Aitherapist
An Emotion-Aware Conversational AI for Supportive Conversations.

Aitherapist is a conversational AI system designed to provide emotion-aware, supportive, and human-like interactions.
Unlike traditional Q&A chatbots, Aitherapist focuses on understanding user emotions, guiding conversations thoughtfully, and creating a calm, empathetic user experience.

Features

Emotion-Aware Conversations
Detects emotional tone and adapts responses accordingly.

Registration and login
Users can create and sign in to their accounts.

Guided, Therapist-Style Flow
Uses reflective statements, gentle questions, and supportive suggestions instead of rigid Q&A.

Coping Strategies
Users can get tips on how to explore alternative perspectives.

Clear & New Chat
Start fresh conversations while maintaining recent chat history.

User Dashboard
users can view their account activities and chat analysis.

Clean, Calming UI
Designed to reduce cognitive load and encourage openness.

Problem Statement

Many chatbots feel robotic and transactional, which limits their usefulness in emotionally sensitive scenarios.
Aitherapist addresses this gap by providing a system that:

  - Listens actively
  
  - Responds empathetically
  
  - Encourages reflection rather than giving direct instructions

System Overview
-- User Interface
-- Conversation Manager
-- Emotion-Aware user input
-- AI Language Model
-- Formatted, Supportive Response

Tech Stack

A) Frontend
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Responsive chat UI
- Message-level interaction (edit, copy, regenerate)
  
B) Backend
- Python (Django / Flask – based on implementation)
- REST API for message handling
- Conversation state management

C) AI Layer
- Prompt-engineered Large Language Model

How Emotion Awareness Works

The system:
  - Analyzes user input for emotional signals
  - Adjusts tone and structure of responses
  
  Balances:
  - Validation
  - Gentle questioning
  - Optional advice
  
  Avoids unsafe or harmful outputs
